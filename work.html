				<p>Have a look at some of the websites I've made so far. I also put a link to my code on <a href="https://github.com/bjmfactory">GitHub</a> for each one.</p>

					<p>Cafe Bedouins is a weekly meetup in Austin. It's a time to work on side projects.</p>

					<p>The first time I went, I met <a href="https://twitter.com/damon">Damon Clinkscales</a>, the guy who started the meetup. I offered to help him make a new website for Cafe Bedouins. </p>

					<p>He had this idea to show Twitter profile photos of the people who are invested in Cafe Bedouins.</p>

					<a href="http://cafebedouins.com"><img src="img/bedouins.png"></a>

					<p>It took me a little while, but with his help I figured out how to get data from a JSON file using Javascript and display it to the page. </p>

					<p>Also, the image alt tags show the persons name and Twitter screen name, and clicking on their face takes you to their Twitter profile!</p>

					<p>It was so cool to get this working. It was also great practice using Javascript, 
						jQuery, AJAX, JSON, and Bootstrap.</p>

					<p>If you're in Austin and you've got a side project you've been wanting to work on, stop by! It's every Tuesday from 7-11pm at <a href="http://www.houndstoothcoffee.com/">Houndstooth Cofeee</a> on 42nd and Lamar. </p>

					<p>Also, here's the Cafe Bedouins <a href="https://twitter.com/cafebedouins">Twitter</a>.</p>

					<p>Bigger or Better is a platform that allows anyone to trade something they have for something they want for free.</p>

					<p>It's a project some of my entrepreneurial friends have been working on, and it will eventually be a mobile app.</p>

					<p>I made a landing page for them. Our goal was to have something simple and clean.</p>

					<a href="http://biggerorbetter.co"><img src="img/better.png"></a>

					<p>It was good practice using HTML and CSS to customize the styling and layout of a form, and it also helped me get more familiar with Bootstrap.</p>

					</div>

					<p>At the risk of being too meta, I've included my personal website (this website).</p>

					<p>Since you're already on this website, you may already know that its purpose is to tell you who I am and show you some of the things I've made.</p>

					<p>It's quite simple. It has a home page, an about page with a longer version of my story, and this page for the things I've made so far.</p>

					<a href="index.html"><img src="img/meta2.png"></a>

					<p>I built this site with HTML and CSS, and I made use of some Bootstrap CSS as well. </p>

					<p>If I were to build it out further, it would make more sense as a PHP site, but I'm planning to keep it simple (it's just those 3 pages now).</p>

					<p>Most likely I'll end up replacing it with a wordpress site with a theme that I customize, but this is fine for now. I wanted to finish something, so that you could read what you just read.</p>
