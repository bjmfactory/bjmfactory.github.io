<h1>July 2, 2014</h1>

<p>Took a walk around the long loop and talked with Jesus. Asked him about all that had been bothering me, and we talked about it.</p>

<p>I said I felt I had failed with my music. He said I had failed long before that and even today, but that he had already forgiven me. </p>

<p>At the creek crossing he directed my attention to the water. See how it flows by and is gone? I direct the course of men's attention in the same way. I could direct them to you in an instant. Do you feel it is possible to catch their eyes? Do not be anxious about it. I will do it if it is to happen.</p>

<p>Also, you are not ready for attention (I agreed). I am preparing you for that. How? You will not care about fame if you are to ever get it, and this is for the best.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>At the view of the mountain he stopped me again and said, look at what I have made. I have made it with dirt and rock and it is fading away. But my word and my purposes will not fade away (Jesus said that!). Do not worry about your music as a work, whether it will last, whether many will see it, whether it will still be meaningful 100 years from now (Ecclesiastes). Concern yourself with me.</p>

<p>At the last creek crossing he stopped me and said, look at this rock, how the water resists it refuses to stop. Many will resist you and go against you, but a few will follow you, and you will be amazed at who is in that number.</p>

<p>And I praised him for his wisdom, his patience, his kindness, his abundance. </p>

<p>I asked him about something else, and he said, next time. Such a good time of prayer, like that time at Walnut Creek. Need to take longer walks and pray more often.</p>
