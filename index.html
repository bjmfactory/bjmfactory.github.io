<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>Hello, I'm Ben. Welcome to my website. I make music under the too-long name &quot;Ben Johnson Music Factory&quot;.</p>
<p>All of my music is <a href="https://bjmfactory.bandcamp.com/">free on bandcamp</a>. I also put it lots of other places for easy access (iTunes, Spotify, etc.) but it's free because it's a gift. It was a gift from God to me, and it's a gift from me to you.</p>
<p>If you love my work and really want to contribute money towards it, I set up a Patreon for that. It's just a way for people to support me if they have the desire, I don't post any special exclusive content there.</p>
<p>Currently I'm working on music for the hours of prayer (you may have heard of vigils, compline, etc.). Each hour has tones already associated with it, and I'm trying to express each one with music.</p>
<p>I also put my music on YouTube, where I have covers of some of my favorite artists (Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Julianna Barwick) and also some original songs. My most popular video is a cover of Roslyn by Bon Iver and St. Vincent.</p>
<p>I have some older albums: two I created around places, one for Alaska and one for Austin, TX, a Christmas album, and my first album.</p>
