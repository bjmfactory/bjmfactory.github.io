					<h1>Here's the story.</h1>

					<p>Hello, my name is Ben Johnson. I'm a composer and aspiring web developer. I've taught myself the basics (with lots of help) and now I'm learning more as an intern at a <a href="http://www.thekompanee.com/" target="_blank">small firm</a> in downtown Austin. This is the story of how I got here.</p>


					<p>Not so long ago, I studied English and music (with a little business too) at The University of Texas at Austin. Near the end of my time there, I came to believe that my future was tied up with the Internet (though I wasn't sure how).</p>

					<p>I took a risk and pursued a career as an independent musician, focusing my efforts online. I spent a year writing, recording, and producing piano music, ending up with somewhere around 200 tracks, around 50 of which I finished, in the form of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/ben-johnson-music-factory/id654854880" target="_blank">4 albums</a>.</p>

					<p>I had some small success. My album inspired by Austin (a city that I came to love during college) somehow ended up <a href="http://kut.org/post/dogs-trains-and-piano-how-austin-sounds-inspired-new-album" target="_blank">on the radio</a>. Later, I did a similar but more ambitious project in <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1348310034/the-alaska-recordings" target="_blank">Alaska</a>.</p>

					<p>But overall it wasn't working. I was making a little money, but not enough. In my Internet travels, though, I had found some strange people called "developers" who knew how to work with the raw building blocks of the Internet, and I was curious to know more about that.</p>

					<p>I started to learn some basic HTML and CSS and I LOVED it. Everything made so much sense to me. Even though my passions are music and writing, I've always been better at math and science, and that part of me loved the organization.</p>

					<p>Then I read <a href="http://blog.dianakimball.com/tagged/coding" target="_blank">Diana Kimball</a> writing about how coding was not only methodical and challenging but also creative and fun. She even called it a "liberal art," and I think that's when I really got it. Web Development combines what I'm naturally good at (math and science) with what I love the most (creating).</p>

					<p>This was all coming together about the same time I was putting the finishing touches on my Alaska album, and by the summer of 2014, I was fully devoted to learning web development. </p>

					<p>I spent that summer reading books, watching tutorials, writing code, making websites, going to meetups in Austin, and asking questions. In short, I learned a great deal.</p>

					<p>Here's a list of some of the things I learned about: HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, SASS, Grunt, PHP, Wordpress, Bootstrap, Angular, Ember, Terminal, Git, GitHub, AJAX, JSON, Node, NPM.</p>

					<p>Now I'm learning more and more about web development as an intern/apprentice/padawan at <a href="http://www.thekompanee.com/" target="_blank">The Kompanee</a>, a small web consulting firm in downtown Austin.</p>

					<p>I love to meet other humans! Send me an <a href="mailto:ben@bjmfactory.com" target="_blank">email</a> or find me on <a href="https://github.com/bjmfactory" target="_blank">Github</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/bjmfactory" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.</p>

          <p>There are other things we can talk about besides web development: piano nocturnes, Glacier National Park, getting up early, Bob Dylan, etc.</p>
