# Contemplative Prayer
# by Thomas Merton



He who walks in darkness, to whom no light appears,
let him trust in the Name of Yahweh,
let him rely upon his God.

-Isaiah 50:10

## Introduction

In prayer you will experience anguish, self-searching, moments of nausea at your own vanity, falsity, and capacity for betrayal.

But this is not some made up thing. It is the truth about who we are. "Worldly life" is only more bearable because of the multitude of distractions and escapes. But under all this, sooner or later we must come face to face with the ultimate meaning of our life.

We realize that to be true to God and to ourselves we must break wth the familiar and the established and go off into the unknown. "Unless a man hat father and mother..." Those words of Christ give some indication of the deep conflict which underlies all Christian conversion––the turning to a freedom based no longer on social approval and relative alienation, but on a direct dependence on an invisible and inscrutable God, in pure faith.

To become serious about prayer is to expose yourself to existential dread, but in a different way from the worldly man. The worldly man experiences dread as boredom and spiritual disorientation. The man of prayer experiences it head on, staring straight into the abyss.

And out of the abyss comes the hope of God. From darkness comes light. From death, life. From the abyss there comes, unaccountably, the mysterious gift of the Spirit sent by God to make all things new, to transform the created and redeemed world, and to re-establish all things in Christ.

## One

The liturgy, which is his joy and which reveals to him the glory of God, cannot fill a heart that has not previously been humbled and emptied by dread.

We are traveling to meet God.

## Two

Contemplative prayer is not so much a way to find God as it is a way of resting in him whom we have found, who loves us, who is near to us, who comes to us to draw us to himself.

We seek God himself in the depths of our being and meet him there by invoking the name of Jesus in faith, wonder, love.

## Three

Prayer is difficult. If we bear with hardship in prayer, we may find it joyful, but we should not judge the value of our meditation by "how we feel." A hard and apparently fruitless meditation may be more valuable than one that is easy, happy, and apparently a big success.

Sometimes prayer is a death, a kind of descent into our own nothingness, a recognition of helplessness, frustration, infidelity, confusion, ignorance. Note how common this theme is in the Psalms. It is not a pleasant thing, but it is part of the journey, and you could even say is for our ultimate good. One thing you can do in these times is pray through relevant passages of scripture (Psalms, maybe gospels).

What does a spiritual father teach us? Not a secret and infallible method for attaining esoteric experiences. No, the father shows us how to recognize God's grace and his will, how to be humble and patient, how to develop insight into our own difficulties, and how to remove the main obstacles keeping us from becoming men of prayer.

We do not want to be beginners, but that is what we will be for all our life.
